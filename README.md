## DSU S22 Curriculum

This is curriculum I wrote alongside my co-director Nick Monozon for the UCLA Data Science Union. The curriculum is designed to prepare new members for the DSU Project ecosystem, which essentially means catching them up to speed with Python and basic Data Science fundamentals. This curriculum covers all of that material with an extra lesson at the end on some intresting deep learning concepts.

Note: these notebooks are usually hosted on google colab (i've downloaded them to host on github), so if the indentation is a bit weird in some of these notebooks, that's why.
